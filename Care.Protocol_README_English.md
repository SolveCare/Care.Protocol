Care.Protocol Specifications 

Care.Protocol is an immutable definition of a Care Network, participant roles, relationships, Care.Journeys, Care.Cards, Care. Events and interoperability

Care.Protocol allows everyone to author fully decentralized, multi-party digital networks that are personalized, autonomous, tokenized and immutable, comprising of decentralized applications (Care.Cards)

Care.Protocol allows everyone to take advantage of the Solve.Care full stack blockchain platform, at lower cost and faster time to market

The Care.Protocol structure defines the entities and the behavior of these entities to each other that together forms the Care.Network. Care.Protocol not only specifies the rules for the network but also enforces the rules on the Network components to ensure it complies with pre-defined behavior. 

Every version of Care.Protocol is also anchored to the Blockchain which helps in immutable, traceable and easily distributable Networks


Care.Protocol has the following configurable definitions to build an end-to-end fully decentralized Care Network

- **Card (cards)**: 

Care.Card is an encapsulated object model that can be considered as a fundamental information block for the CareWallet and Solve.Care platform. Just like a data collection or table, Care.Card is an object that encapsulates various data types and actionability. A Care.Card is owned by Wallet and Node. It is a struct with multiple data types, permission properties, encryption and interface linked to an Event.

On Wallet A Care.Card can be thought as user interface card with underlying data and behavior encapsulation

This section of Care.Protocol defines the Care.Card and its behavior when building a Care Journey

For example – A Doctor sending prescription to a patient is an event.

Every Event has an originator in form of Card on Wallet or Node. Events are consumed by Wallet and Node
